# CYANUS: Systematic CyTOF Data Analysis

#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/CYANUS](https://shinyappstore.com/a/CYANUS)__

CYANUS is an application designed for the systematic evaluation of various approaches for Differential Expression Analysis on both Real and Simulated CyTOF (time-of-flight mass cytometry) Data. The application, including the Shiny App CYANUS, offers a user-friendly interface and provides several built-in datasets, such as PBMC, CytoGLMM, and semi-simulated COVID-19 datasets. These datasets, including their down sampled versions, can be generated in DataGeneration. Notably, CYANUS supports user-uploaded datasets, enhancing its flexibility for diverse analyses. The application is particularly relevant in the context of high-dimensional CyTOF, a technology capable of identifying parameters simultaneously. In contrast to traditional flow cytometry, CyTOF simplifies the process by enabling the simultaneous measurement of multiple markers, making it a potent tool for unveiling new cell subtypes, functions, and biomarkers.
